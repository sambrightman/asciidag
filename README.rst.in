Overview
--------

This is a direct port of the `Git`_ log graphing code, which draws
directed acyclic commit graphs as ASCII art. It was done very
mechanically and quickly, so the code is not Pythonic. Dependencies on
`Git`_ specifics should be gone but look and feel remains.

This project is alpha quality and subject to breaking API changes.

    .. note::
       💡
       If you are thinking about doing a large refactoring, please submit
       an issue for discussion first; I consider it potentially worthwhile
       to stay close to the `Git`_ source.

Installation
------------

Available for install/upgrade from `PyPI`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U asciidag

As usual, it is best to install your packages into a `virtual environment`_.

Usage
-----

``examples/demo.py`` is included in the installation directory and is
executable. The core functionality is:

.. include:: examples/demo.py
   :code: python
   :start-after: # start-after
   :end-before: # end-before

Output:

.. image:: images/demo.png?raw=true
